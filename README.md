# Function-Excercises
## These are all practice excercises of different functions:
* how to get JS to pick a random value from an array and how to insert a function into an element using .textContent or .innerHTML
* HTML canvas references used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp 
* Using reference variable canvas and context ctx to createa function that draws rectangles in the canvas
* Using the given variables and method .beginPath(), .rect(), .fillStyle
* Converting random() function into a more broader spectrum using min and max values then using the random function in the array by replacing the min -> 0 and max -> array.length by taking the array to choose from a paramter makes the code more flexible.
* Using array.filter() to get an array of only names shorter than 5 characters and inputing an arrow function into the code to make it simplier filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
* Creatng functions and using the nchange event handler to create a code that tells you the squared, cued, and factorial value oof the number the user inputs.
